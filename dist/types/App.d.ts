/**
 * AppUnique
 *
 * A toggle-driven cookbook that mirrors the guidance in `App.tsx`, while showcasing
 * the newer UI override hooks, custom cards, and fully custom render paths in one place.
 *
 * Adjust the booleans and selectors below to switch between common deployment scenarios
 * (Cloud, Community Edition, Hybrid), UI strategies (prebuilt UI, no-UI, or fully custom),
 * and customization layers (card builders, component overrides, container styling).
 *
 * Every configuration block is wrapped in a clearly named toggle so you can enable/disable
 * a feature by flipping a single value or commenting it out. The component is intentionally
 * verbose to double as living documentation that developers can copy, trim, or expand.
