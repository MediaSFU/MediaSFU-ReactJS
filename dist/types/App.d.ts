/**
 * MediaSFU Modern UI Component Configuration and Usage Guide
 *
 * This file demonstrates how to use the Modern MediaSFU UI components
 * with glassmorphic design, matching the Flutter main_modern.dart example.
 *
 * The Modern UI includes:
 * - Glassmorphic control bars and modals
 * - Dark mode by default with enableGlassmorphism option
 * - Animated transitions and blur effects
 * - Modern card components for video/audio/mini displays
 *
 * All the same functionality as MediasfuGeneric but with
 * the new modern UI components.
